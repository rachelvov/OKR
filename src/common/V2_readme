*****Running V2 conversion****
in order to convert am xml ouput file to V2 object run:
python -i  V2Conversion.py <oath to file>
For example:
python -i  V2Conversion.py ../../data/baseline/dev/armstrong_doping.xml 


*****V2 class documentation****
The code first translates the xml file into an OKR object (using OKR.py in this directory)
and than coverges the OKR object into a V2 object with the following classes:

V2.name #object_name
V2.sentences #original sentences (same as in okr)
V2.argument_alignment # a dictionary of node_id to a list of edges all belonging to the same argument of the node
V2.nodes #a dictionary of node_id to node
		Node.id #id of node- currenty "E+original_entity_id" or "P+original_proposition_id"
		--Node.name #name of node, the same as the name of original entity/proposition
		#change to terms set? (in apparatness - label). each term with its mention ids	
		Node.label #a set of all the mention terms of this node
		Node.entailment=entailment #entailment graph for node (see entailment_graph object in okr)
		Node.mentions #dictionary of mention_id to mention of node
			NodeMention.id = id #id of mention - same as in okr (an int)
        		NodeMention.sentence_id = sentence_id#sentence in which the mention appear
        		NodeMention.indices = indices #indices of the mention
       			NodeMention.term = term #words in the mention
        		NodeMention.parent = parent #id of the node to which the node mention belong
			#Add lemma of term
			#add POS?
			
V2.edges #a dictionary of edge_id to edge 
	Edge.id #edge id - currently in the format of "<Node_id of first node>+_+<Node_id of second node>"
	Edge.nodes_pair #the pair of edges the node connects
	@@change to set of terms, with edge mentions id of each term
	@@Edge.label# set of all templates of all mentions
	Edge.mentions #dictionary of mention id to mention
		Edge.EdgeMention.id#edge mention id - currently in the form of "original_proposition_id+_+original_mention_id" 
        	Edge.EdgeMention.sentence_id #sentence of mention
        	Edge.EdgeMention.indices #indices of mention (index or indices of the non-content words in template)
		Edge.EdgeMention.nodes_mentions_pair #the pair of nodes mentions which this mention connect
       		Edge.EdgeMention.terms #terms of edge mention (term or terms of the non-content words in template)
       		Edge.EdgeMention.template #template of edge mention (full "r" template)
		Edge.EdgeMention.parent #the edge the mention belongs to
